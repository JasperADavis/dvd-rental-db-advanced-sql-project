#Project Title

DVD Rental Data Exploration

#Description

This project showcases several SQL queries (used in PostgreSQL) to analyze data from a dvd rental dataset. The insights from these queries are then modeled graphically with brief descriptions in the `report.pdf` file.

These queries make use of window functions, CTE (common table expressions), aggregating, filtering, and joins.
