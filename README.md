<h1>Project Title</h1>
DVD Rental Data Exploration

<h2>Date created</h2>
This project was initially created in June of 2020 as part of Udacity's Advanced SQL course, part of their Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.


<h2>Description</h2>

This project showcases several SQL queries (used in PostgreSQL) to analyze data from a dvd rental dataset. The insights from these queries are then modeled graphically with brief descriptions in the `report.pdf` file.

These queries make use of window functions, CTE (common table expressions), aggregating, filtering, and joins.
